// Package simba is a high-performance runtime and tooling layer that lets Go
// applications leverage SIMD-accelerated routines implemented in Rust. It
// exposes safe, idiomatic Go wrappers around vectorized functions compiled from
// Rust intrinsics and linked via CGo. Refer to the README for usage examples
// and the project roadmap.
